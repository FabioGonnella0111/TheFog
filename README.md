Downloads:

How to import the project in unity:

The game consists of surviving as long as possible by killing enemies that spawn repeatedly endlessly.
the game is in its embryonic stage and yet to be completed.
With this project I just wanted to lay the foundations for a 2D survival platform game.

How the game works:

- to move, press the directional arrows or ASD
- press SPACEBAR to jump
- press Q to attack
